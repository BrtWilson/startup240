CS 240 notes and start up application

Section 1. Elevator Pitch
----------------
People have a small obsession with running games: Subway Surfer, Temple Run, Flappy Bird, Dinosaur Game...

My pitch is to combine this popular game style with one of the top game fandoms in history: Pokemon.
Pokemon run allows users to enjoy the run with their favorite cute pokemon, powering them up over time and catching more along the way.
Rare candies, pokeballs, and other power-ups will enhance the experience and be the foundation for a simple yet expandable game in a world of pokemon.

Section 2. Startup Application Details
--------------------------------------

Brainstorming ideas:
- pokemon version of the jumping t-rex game
- obstacles include miscelaneous platforms and other pokemon
- flying pokemon can fly
- two controls: spacebar for jump and click for attack
- power-up ideas:
	* pokeball: allows capturing new pokemon (button to activate? or emil-esque)
		- more powerful pokeballs are required for more powerful pokemon (1/10th chance of success if one tier too high, 1/35th chance success if beyond 1 tier difference; 100% chance if pokeball power is adequate)
		- used on nearest pokemon when button is activated
	* rare candy: exp (common)
	* evolution stone fragments (correspond to biome, rare, need 3 to make the item)
	* some item that enhances attacks (less common)
	* some item that enhances defense (less common)
- store top score and pokemon unlocked online
- pokemon can evolve with enough exp
- new biomes can be unlocked with enough points; or by traveling far enough
	* different biomes will have different pokemon associated with them
- Base Pokemon:
	* Bulbasaur
	* Squirtle
	* Charmander
	* Ratata
	* Eevee
	* Jigglypuff
- Possible stats: hp (10avg), speed, jump, flight, acceleration/buildup?)
- function: run ends when hp goes out (avg 10hp?), returns to a login menu, and another menu has the pokemon options and item options
