Section 2. Startup Application Details
--------------------------------------

Brainstorming ideas:
- pokemon version of the jumping t-rex game
- obstacles include miscelaneous platforms and other pokemon
- flying pokemon can fly
- two controls: spacebar for jump and click for attack
- power-up ideas:
	* pokeball: allows capturing new pokemon (button to activate? or emil-esque)
		- more powerful pokeballs are required for more powerful pokemon
	* rare candy: exp
	* evolution stones (correspond to biome)
	* some item that enhances attacks
	* some item that enhances defense
- store top score and pokemon unlocked online
- pokemon can evolve with enough exp
- new biomes can be unlocked with enough points; or by traveling far enough
	* different biomes will have different pokemon associated with them
- Base Pokemon:
	* Bulbasaur
	* Squirtle
	* Charmander
	* Ratata
	* Eevee
	* Jigglypuff
- Possible stats: hp (10avg), speed, jump, flight, acceleration/buildup?)
- function: run ends when hp goes out (avg 10hp?), returns to a login menu, and another menu has the pokemon options and item options
